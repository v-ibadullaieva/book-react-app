# Install

1) Install MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
2) Install server & client dependencies ```npm i && cd client && npm i && cd ../```
3) Install node-mongo-seeds ```npm i -g node-mongo-seeds```
4) Seed database ```seed```
5) Run dev server ```npm start```

# Project

Front-end is located in ```client``` directory (note that client dependencies are separated from server)
```npm start``` runs both server and client

# Task

Your goal is to develop book collections web app.
Collection and books are represented as json objects:
```
// Collection
{
    "name": "Collection name",
    "description": "Books collection description",
    "books": [...] // list of books
}

// Book
{
    "name": "Book name",
    "author": "Book Author",
    "price": 100,
    "rating": 5 // optional
}
```

Required features:
* Display list of collections
* Display single collection with included books
* Edit collection data
* Add/Remove Book from collection
* Rate book
* Using Redux for state management
* Using Redux-Saga or Redux-Observable for managing side effects

Nice-to-haves:
* Create book form
* Create collection form

Visual part is not so important and totally up to you.
You can use any CSS Framework or React Components lib
